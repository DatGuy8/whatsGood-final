# What's Good
 A food review platform, designed for foodies. This app centers around a simple idea: making it easy for food enthusiasts to share and discover reviews of individual dishes from various restaurants.

 I built this app to address a frustration I have with sites like Yelp - the overwhelming amount of information. With a user-friendly interface, you can quickly find out which dishes are highly recommended at different eateries.
